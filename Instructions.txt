For this assignment, you will create a C#/.NET Console Application that follows the Repository Pattern, using a type of ICollection or IEnumerable (such as a List, Dictionary or Queue) as a mock database. You will need the repository itself, a User Interface that uses the Console to allow for user interaction with the repository, and a set of Unit Tests.

You should have been given a repository challenge as a morning challenge to complete the POCO and repository classes.

If not, then choose one of the options at the bottom.

 

Format
You will turn in a GitHub link to a repository that contain a single C# solution with 3 Projects:

1. Class Library with a POCO and a Repository class

POCO: 

Basic object to be contained in a collection 
Has properties
Repository: 

Contains a collection of items (in a List, Dictionary or Queue)
Has CRUD methods to interact with the collection
Can have properties/fields of its own
2. A Console App with a ProgramUI class

Program.cs creates an instance of ProgramUI and runs it

ProgramUI has Console methods to interact with repo

3. A Unit Test Project with a Unit Test class (or a few)

Test Class has test methods to test Repo CRUD methods (for instance, get an item from the repo, assert that it was retrieved correctly)

 

 

Options

You can choose from any of the following options (these should be the same as the morning challenge):

 

Delivery Service 
Warner Transit Federal is finally going electronic with their delivery tracking. They need an electronic record of current and past deliveries 

Repo type: List 

You need to build an app that will (repo methods): 

Add a new delivery to the history (Create)
List all en route deliveries, and all completed deliveries (Read)
Update the status of a delivery (Update)
Cancel a delivery (Delete)
Each delivery will need (POCO): 

The order date 
The delivery date 
The status of the order (Scheduled, EnRoute, Complete, or Canceled)
The Item number
The item quantity
The customer ID (you can assume every customer has an account with a unique ID number of some kind)
